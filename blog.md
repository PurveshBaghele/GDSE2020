# Future of Nearshoring
## Questions

- Is nearshoring going to be the new standard of doing software development?
- Is a combination of farshoring and nearshoring a better alternative than just farshoring or nearshoring?

- lower risk and more control over product

Unitl now in our blog posts we discussed the benefits of nearshoring, key success and failure factors for nearshoring and case studies related to near shoring. In this blog we discuss the future of nearshoring.


In the last decade nearshoring has caught up some speed world-wide, especially in Europe. Regions like Central and Eastern Europe regions have been popular candidates for nearshoring for Wester Europe. Another example is Mexico, where operations from USA are being increasingly nearshored. The nearshoring approach does not necessarily provide biggest cost-savings but is associated with lower risks and more control over product. A study [1] of nearshoring activities by Scandinavian countries in Lithuania shows that nearshoring is no longer driven only by cost minimisation, but more by access to strategic assets, markets and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) related factors.

Drawbacks of offshoring to distant countries also makes nearshoring a better option. Impediments such as different time-zones, cultural habits and work ethics are some of the  drawbacks. Further we discuss some global trends that could lead to **emergence of nearshoring as a new standard for IT industry**.


**Automation** using **AI** and **ML** is one rise now more than ever, which leads to less manual labour in production. Software development has also changed over the years due to intervention of automation: from coding to testing to deployment. Automation in software development leads to less requirement of  workforce but increase in monitoring and support. Nearshoring approach provides more over-lapping work hours which suits the purpose of mointoring and support.

Moreover, developing AI and ML based software needs workforce with expertise such as Data Scientists and Engineers. With more and more organisations gathering data and hunting for data scientists, acute shortage of highly skilled data scientists [2] is a persisting barrier and is going to be one of the major problems in future. This barrier further fuels the impetus for organisation to outsource AI/ML development.
