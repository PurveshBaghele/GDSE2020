# Globally Distributed Software Engineering

## Module 1 

### Intro
Software engineering distributed over the world (at least two location and continents)

Adding distance in software engineering leads to negative impact: 
1) communication
2) coordination
3) control

Types of Distance: 
- Geographical (KM or time required to travel)
- Temporal (timezone-distance or % overlapping hours)
- Language (Language distance, native vs non-native)
- Cultural ( different cultures at different places)

GDSE involves : Distributed, technological support, globalization, cross-cultural, virtual teams

### Why GDSE

- Access to **scarce resource** and **expertise**
- Faster and round-the-clock development
- Lower development cost
- Low Geographical distance to customers
- History (merge and acquistions)

#### Centrifugal forces of GDSE :
- Cultural differences
- Loss of "teamness"
- Geographical dispersion 
- Coordination breakdown
- Loss of communication richness

** These forces lead to lot of rework. **

#### Centripetal forces of GDSE (forces that help tackling cetrifugal forces):
- Managerial techniwues
- Product architecture
- Telecomm infrastructure
- collaborative technology
- Team building practices
- Development methodology (agile,scrum)

** Paradox of GDSE ** : We need more coordination but we keep adding more location which makes it even harder to coordinate

### Cultural Differences

Six dimensions to measure cultural differences :
- Power Distance Index (PDI) (high PDI leads to simply following order)
- Individualism (IDV) (Lower IDV look towards larger froups)
- Masculinity (MAS) (high MAS leads to conflicts)
- Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI) (Low UAI means more risk taking)
- Long-Term Orientation (LTO) (High LTO are cultures who think of long-term)
- Indulgence (IND) (High IND are cultures which allows enjoying oneself more)

Quest for GDSE: creating the virtual 50 meters

1) Discover Best-practices for GDSE
2) Technoilogical support for successful GDSE
3) Distributes agile development
4) Follow-the-sun software development (work follows wherever sun is shining/ The GDSE stress-testing)
5) Teaching GDSE dynamics

### GDSE at Exact :
1) Team and people availability 
2) Scrum helps in ferequent contact (Don't rely on written communication)
3) product vision should be clear to everyone and define a product strategy (product-customer knowledge)

People Factors: 
1) people need to know each other : e.g cultural awareness, be nice and professional, Rhythm and transparency.
